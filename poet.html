                <h1>Mirza Ghalib</h1>
                <h1>(1797-1869)</h1>
            </div>
            <p>Mirza Ghalib, whose full name is Mirza Asadullah Baig Khan, was a prominent and highly regarded Urdu and
                Persian poet during the Mughal Empire's decline in India. He was born on December 27, 1797, in Agra,
                India, and died on February 15, 1869, in Delhi.
                Ghalib is considered one of the most significant and influential poets in the Urdu and Persian literary
                traditions. His poetry is known for its deep philosophical insights, intricate metaphors, and profound
                exploration of human emotions. He is often celebrated for his ability to capture the complexities of
                life, love, loss, and spirituality in his verses.
                Ghalib's poetry reflects the social, cultural, and political changes of his time, as he lived through
                the tumultuous period of the British colonial rule and the decline of the Mughal Empire. He navigated
                these changes in his poetry, blending traditional Persian forms with contemporary themes.</p>

                <h1>Allama Iqbal</h1>
                <h1>(1877-1938)</h1>
            </div>
            <p>Allama Muhammad Iqbal, often referred to as "Mufakkir-e-Pakistan" (The Thinker of Pakistan) and
                "Shair-e-Mashriq" (The Poet of the East), stands as one of the most illustrious and multifaceted
                personalities in the history of South Asia. Born on November 9, 1877, in Sialkot, a town in what is now
                Pakistan, Iqbal emerged as a visionary philosopher, poet, scholar, and political thinker whose ideas and
                writings left an indelible mark on the intellectual, cultural, and political landscape of the Indian
                subcontinent.
                Iqbal's early education was marked by an exceptional intellect and an insatiable curiosity for
                knowledge. He pursued his studies in various institutions, including Government College Lahore and the
                universities of Cambridge and Munich, where he delved into Western philosophy, literature, and history.
                His profound understanding of both Eastern and Western thought allowed him to synthesize diverse
                philosophical traditions, resulting in a unique and innovative perspective.</p>
